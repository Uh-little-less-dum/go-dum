# ULLD Go Tools


This is sort of a wrapper repo to house the build, cli, and development ULLD tools written in Go, basically just to share code in a single Go workspace while still being able to publish each repository independently, without spending too much time upfront on configuring go-releaser.

If you have a better idea as to how to handle this, trust me... I'm open to them.


### Handling the submodule structure

Don't forget to clone with the recursive submodules flag:

```zsh
git clone --recursive-submodules git@github.com:Uh-little-less-dum/go-dum.git
```
